    // block 1:
    // since var is hoisted by default so it will not throw an error it will just give us an undefined 
    // because hoisting in js brings the declarations upside when processing the code but not its assigned value 
    // too so the code knows there is a parameter named a but it has nothing in it so the console will throw undefined.

    // the clg of foo() has no problem because we brought our function declaration to the top then logged it to the console. 

    function funcA() {
        var a = 1;
        console.log(a);
        console.log(foo());

    //  block 2:
    //  let fullName = 'Colin Ihrig'; makes it undefined because var is a global statement 
    //  and let and const is "local" so it can't be penetrated from method that is not in 
    //  the same boat or out of it's scope.

    //  it prints "Aurelio De Rosa" it takes the most recent value
    //  and because "this" takes only what insides its father's object 
    //  so if we take "fullName: 'Aurelio De Rosa'" out of the prop object scope
    //  it will prints undefined because it knows there is a value called fullname from 
    //  outside the object but has no value.

    var fullName = 'John Doe';

    // block 3: 
    // defining "a = b = 0" DO mean that first of all define b = 0 and then give a 
    // the value that b has it. that means a has local and b has a global value 
    // so a will not be seen out of funcB() scope

    // black 4: 
    // in js the console will process the most recent value so the first funcC(); takes the most recent 
    // declaration which prints 2 then will come the second call which will do the same thing
    // therefore the code will be read like this. the code cant be fixed when the functions 
    // has the same names however u can change its names or remove the whole second func
    // and cut the log to the first one. and execute the code once
