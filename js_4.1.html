    //6-  with 3= what happens is this condition  if (numSibilings ===1 ) cant be done because they have diffrent types
    //7-  with string will have No sibilings because the else block prevent any other type but string
    //8-  because it stricts any other types from being inputted and thats on its role of preventing conflicts
