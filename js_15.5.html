    //1- basically too much added spaces that takes space in the memory for nothing 

    // 2- line 26. the main problem is where we have counter + 1. here when initializing the code 
    // it is right that it will add to count one but it will not store it in the value count 
    // because it is an operation like any another doing it just in place. so if put it in another 
    // parameter it will work or if logged it out to the console. we can solve that by putting 
    // counter++ which it equals "counter += 1" so it adds and storing it to our variable counter
    //  
    function countOccurrences(str, char) {
        let counter = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
            if (str.charAt(i) === char) {
                counter++;
            }
        }
        return counter;
    }
