    // 1- first of all it is recommended to use let not var when defining a new possibly changing variables 
    // 2- the function called calcAverage and it returns the sum of an array elements
    //      so to correct that we need to divide on the length of the array

    // 3-   the most important error is the sum is declared but not has no any variable yet
    //      So the when adding to it or dividing it by another number we will have NAN value  
    //      because we are doing operations to a not a number value to a true value so it will  
    //      always be NAN. therefore we can solve that by assign a initial value to sum like 0. 

    function calcAverage(arr) {
        var sum = 0;
        for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];
        }
        return sum / arr.length;
    }
    calcAverage([85, 90, 92]);
